# Zap Challenge

The goal of the test is to implement an app where we can see the games with the most views in Twitch. The app should show a list of games and be able to navigate to the details of each game. In addition, both in the list and on the details screen, it should be possible to favor the game. Favorite games must be persisted on the device so they can be accessed offline and shown on a tab itself.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software.

```
1 - Xcode 9+
2 - Swift 4
3 - CocoaPods
```

### Installing

Firs of all, you need install the Xcode 9, you can find it in the App Store.

```
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
```

After you must install the CocoaPods.

CocoaPods is built with Ruby and it will be installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version manager, however we recommend that you use the standard Ruby available on macOS unless you know what you're doing.

Using the default Ruby install will require you to use sudo when installing gems. (This is only an issue for the duration of the gem installation, though.)

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Lastly you need open the Terminal, go to Project root folder, and run this code:

```
$ pod install
```

Now you have all elements to run this project
